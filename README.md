Project two artifacts 

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it is best practice to organize your code in such a way that blocks that have different functions are seprate.  Additionally, it is important to leave in-line comments to explain the functions of important or potentially confusing lines of code.  Considering logical names for variables and functions also helps with improving the ease of working with programs.  Using a CRUD module was beneficial in containig crucial class methods that will be called in other files.  By separating the class methods from other files, the program becomes less dense and you are able to filter out parts of the program that may not be needed at the time.



How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

To approach a problem as a computer scientist, you first take the time to specify the goals for solving the problem.  After this definition, identifying the steps needed to take to solve the problem is the next step, with the implementation of this plan following that.  With the database/dashboard requirements for the Grazioso Salvare project, I first ensured that I knew what was requested for the program.  I did this by reading the documetnation provided which contained the specific requests for the program.  After this, I investigated ways to satisfy the needs of the program, and once I had decided on a method, I implemented it.  In the future, I would take a similar strategy to meet client requests, because I think that taking the time to define a problem and search for possible solutions will result in improved deliverables, and result in a much more organized program.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists work to automate or simplify complicated tasks through the use of computers.  This is important because by creating a program to simplify complex or cumbersome tasks, workplace efficiency and accuracy can be improved.  This also frees time and reosources to be used in other, more beneficial ways.  My work on this type of project would help companies save time and money on labor, for example, if they had to sort through `000+ documents to find specific data related to a certain criteria.  Using a database and an interface to interact with the database is a far more efficient way to access specific information when there is a large volume of data to sift through.
